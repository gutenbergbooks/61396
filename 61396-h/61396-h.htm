<p>The human race is like a snake—it sheds. Ever and anon, as the
ages bloom, old forms of thought are superseded by intellectual
bran-news. Shrines at which one generation adores become to the
succeeding desolate and despised.</p>
<p>This little brochure has a mission. It is not a formidable one,
but it is. It goes out with the hope that it may help, if ever so
infinitesimally, in ridding the human of that terrific instinct of
<em>inconsideration</em> toward the sub-human races. Solidarity is
its plea, human and universal.</p>
<p>It would be inexcusable to suppose it to be exhaustive. It is
not even defensive. It is a projectile, and projectiles do not
apologize.</p>
<p>It intends to be followed.</p>

<h2 class="uppercase">Why I Am a Vegetarian.</h2>
<p>I am not here to convert you to vegetarianism. I know too well
the nature of mind to commit any such blunder. I am here to talk
English and, if possible, give you glimpses. I can not hope in half
a hundred minutes to rinse from your brains sand bars that have
been ages in depositing. It is no holiday matter to emancipate
one’s self from an old, inveterate slavery. It is a task so
formidable that few do it without help. It requires a courage and
an iconoclasm greater than most possess to make heroic initiatives.
But after a reform is accomplished and its principles become
matters of course, there are then few persons without the ability
to look back and wonder why idiots are so much like men.</p>
<p>Men are somnambulistic. Stupefied by the long night of instinct
out of which it arose, the human mind is only half awake.
Washington was the father of a country, but he held human beings as
slaves and paid his hired help in Virginia whisky. It took
Americans one hundred years to find out that “all men” included
Ethiopians. Men who risked their lives to achieve personal and
political liberty for black men deliberately doom white women to a
similar servitude. Rich men give millions to museums or
universities, when they would know, if they had the talent to stop
and think, that the thousands who make their wealth work like
wretches from morning till night and suffocate in garrets and feed
on garbage, in order that they may be munificent. Human beings
preach as the cardinal of morality that they should act upon others
as they would be pleased to have others act upon them, and then
take the most sensitive and beautiful beings all palpitating with
life, and chop them into fragments with a composure that would do
honor to the managers of an inferno.</p>
<p>It has been said that when a proposition is presented to us for
our acceptance or rejection we treat it as we would treat an
article of furniture presented to us for our apartments. We try it.
If it fits in character and complexion, we accept it, and it
becomes a part of our paraphernalia. If it does not fit, we reject
it. Every proposition that comes to our intelligence is thus
accepted or dismissed, depending on the congeniality or
uncongeniality of the subjective and the objective. It is
impossible absolutely for mind, constituted as it is on the earth,
to accept a proposition that is antagonistic to it. And when a
proposition is presented to the mind, the only way in the world to
win its acceptance is by coaxing and modifying the mind itself. I
come to you tonight with a proposition. In a very feeble and
fragmentary way I attempt to do what every polemic attempts to
do—to dynamite your minds, to havoc their foundations and
reconstruct them in harmony with the proposition I champion. But
there are so many attitudes of opposition possible, so many
objections that are thinkable, and so many things assumed by those
who pitch themselves against it, that I cannot hope in one evening
to accomplish more than a beginning. But if I can somehow succeed
in dilating your pupils a little, and enable you to realize in some
measure the infamy in which you and the rest of the occidental
world are today engaged, I shall feel better than if I had spoken
to stones.</p>
<p>I want to remind you and warn you that it makes no difference
how just a proposition may be and how universally and unreservedly
it may be ultimately accepted, its beginning is always a period of
interrogation and war. When Garrison first announced the
proposition denying the right to auction Ethiopians, the
proposition was assailed by the most formidable volleys of
objection. Those objections seem puerile today, but in the days in
which this proposition found few heads in which to hide, they were
axioms of ethical and political science. So when you take an
attitude on this proposition <em>remember</em> there are future
generations as well as this one, and <em>be careful</em> that you
do not make the same spectacle of yourself that poor old Webster
and other blind men made when they poured cold water down the
spines of early Abolitionists.</p>
<p>I became a vegetarian by my own reflection. I did not know at
the time of the vegetarian movement, and, hence supposed myself
alone among republics of carnivora. It did not seem to me graceful
or ideal that I, an ethical being, should maintain my existence at
the incessant expense of misery and death to others. But the
problem that for some time tormented me was whether it were
possible to keep up a successful and at all interesting existence
without ox-hips. I wondered whether the universe were so
constructed that it were impossible for its most endowed children
to live without the crudest and most recreant egoism. There is now
no remnant of a doubt about the possibilities of a bloodless
existence, nor even of its positive hygienic advantages. I had been
considerable of a vulture, and for sometime after eliminating flesh
from my menus I had desire for it. But gradually that desire faded,
and there came in its stead a growing horror of flesh. The grinding
of the tissues of my fellow beings seemed horribly akin to the
chewing of the emotions of my friends. After a few weeks of fruits
and vegetables there came over me a feeling of exultation and
superiority and crispness that was truly novel. Today, I am
thoroughly emancipated from the coils of kreophagy. I shall go down
to my grave and out into the darkling hereafter with a bloodless
digestion, if I am the only animal in the universe to do so. The
flesh-tearing performances which I am compelled everywhere to
behold seem to me to be the lurid deeds of maniacs rather than the
time and premeditated acts of sane beings. And I can but pity, not
only the creatures whose throats are severed and whose skeletons
are stripped, but the blind and reckless cannibals who perpetrate
these crimes. When the whole earth teems with such a bewildering
variety of beautiful and bloodless fruits, it seems so strange and
so sad and so frightful that man should continue the barbarous,
blood-sucking practices of the world’s infancy.</p>
<p>Vegetarianism is the neglect by one being to suppress another
for nutritive purposes. I believe in it. I believe I should neglect
to suppress the interests and lives of <em>non</em>-human beings
for identically the same reason I should neglect to suppress the
interests and lives of <em>human</em> beings. The exploitation of
birds and quadrupeds for human whim or convenience is an offense
not different in kind from the offenses denounced in human statutes
as robbery and murder. And the same logic which impels abstinence
from one of these offenses impels everyone who has the power to be
consistent to refrain from all of them.</p>
<p>There is, in fact, but one crime in the universe and all
varieties of impropriety whatsoever are aspects or phases of this
crime. It is the crime of <em>exploitation</em>—the suppression of
the interests, lives, or welfares of some beings for the whim or
convenience of others—the neglect to recognize the equal or the
approximately equal rights of all to life, consideration and
happiness—the crime of doing to others as you would that others
would <em>not</em> do to you.</p>
<p>I look back over the ages of this world—not the ages of human
history simply, for the history of the human species is but a
little section, the remembered chapter, in the history of the
evolutions which have been performed by mundane life. I look back
to the beginning of life on this planet—back 50,000,000 of years
ago, when the first protoplasmic specks sprawled in primeval seas.
Life originated in the sea fifteen hundred thousand human
generations ago. After ages of evolution it crept out upon the
continents, subsequently entered the forests, climbed and clambered
among the trees, became endowed with perpendicularity and hands,
descended and walked upon the soil, invented agriculture, built
cities and states—and here we are. Human civilization is but the
van, the hither terminus, of an evolutional process which had its
beginning away back in the protoplasm of primeval slime. The
philosopher is the remote posterity of the meek and lowly
monad.</p>
<p>Now, this whole enterprise, this entire process of biological
evolution, has been accomplished by the survival from age to age of
the fittest to survive; that is, by the subjection and elimination
of the weak and the simple by the more powerful and sophisticated,
And the disposition to exploit manifested by every animal that
breathes, from philosopher to fish, is a disposition which has been
implanted in the natures of living beings by the necessities of
evolution. The great task of reforming the universe, therefore, is
the task of eliminating from the natures of its inhabitants the
disposition to be inhospitable, egoistic and merciless, which has
been everywhere developed by evolution.</p>
<p>In the ideal universe the life and happiness of no being are
contingent upon the suffering and death of any other. And the fact
that in this universe of ours life and happiness have been and are
today so largely maintained by the infliction of indescribable
misery and extinction, is the most pathetic, the most stupendous,
and the most sickening contemplation that ever invaded human mind.
It is encouraging to know, however, that life in its highest forms,
that is, as represented by the most cultured aggregates of the
human species, is evolving rapidly and irrepressibly toward the
ideal, that is, toward a social state in which the interests and
life of each individual being are more and more equally precious.
What are civilization and morality? What do we mean by ethical
progress? The growth of consideration for others—nothing
more—simply cessation of, or abstinence from, exploitation.
Courtesy, kindness, justice, altruism, humanity, what are they?
They are the qualities which distinguish those who put themselves
in the place of others, who recognize the existence and the
preciousness of others, and who act upon others as they themselves
would be pleased to have others act upon them. Otherism is the
antithesis of <em>laissez faire</em>. The growth of civility in the
earth is the growth of the principle or consciousness of solidarity
among its inhabitants.</p>
<p>Vegetarianism, therefore, that is, abstinence from non-human
exploitation or the recognition of universal solidarity, is related
from this exalted standpoint to the logic of the Magna Charta, the
Declaration of Independence and the modern movements of social
reform. The sympathies of the consistent vegetarian go out
naturally to the stricken and oppressed everywhere—to Cuba in her
struggle for autonomy, to Ireland in her misery, to the helpless
quadruped quivering under the pole-ax, and to the pitiable
proletarian who goes up and down the monopolized universe seeking
in vain for opportunities to earn honest nutrition. The vegetarian
who is conscious enough to be consistent is in love with the
universe, not simply with his wife or clan or species. He strives
to be graceful to every being whose destinies he contacts, however
humble or hopeless or eccentric that being may be.</p>
<p>I am a vegetarian because I believe that present-day ethics is
founded on that puerile, pre-Darwinian delusion that all other
kinds of creatures and all worlds were created explicitly
<em>for</em> the hominine species. Vegetarianism is the ethical
corollary of evolution. It is simply the expansion of ethics to
suit the biological revelations of Charles Darwin. Evolution has
taught us the kinship of all creatures. The ancient hiatus between
man and the other animals has been effectually sewed up. Biology
teaches us, if it teaches us anything, that there is a solidarity
of the sentient world. Man is simply <em>one</em> of a
<em>series</em> of sentients, differing in degree but not in kind
from the creatures below and around him. The ox he enslaves and
slays and the poor reptile that wriggles in his pathway are his
brothers, partaking of his nature and sharing his destiny. Man is
simply the adult of long evolution, and his qualities are, of
course, found among the juveniles and infants of the sentient
world. The industrious bee, the civilized ant, the devoted steed,
the mischievous ape, the irascible serpent, the sagacious elephant,
the beautiful gazelle and the great, honest ox have within them in
embryo all the emotions that roll through the soul of man. Fear,
love, fidelity, hate, jealousy, joy, selfishness, curiosity,
remorse, are all found everywhere, and they are the same passions
that heave your breast and mine. Chastity, sobriety, obedience,
personal cleanliness, industry, sympathy, self-control, friendship,
heroism, sagacity—many dogs and other semi-civilized animals have
all these qualities, and in a greater degree even than whole races
of men. And these faculties and capacities of the non-hominine
world are the same identical faculties and capacities that you have
and I have. Industry and ingenuity in the beaver are just as
genuine and just as commendable as the same qualities in man. The
faithful dog who stood over the lifeless body of his master
grieving for recognition and starting at every flutter of his
garments till he himself died of starvation, was just as noble as
if he had all his days walked on his hind legs and worn a cane. The
wild bird who takes her life in her wings to save her nestlings
from the voracious serpent, and the mother bear away on the Arctic
snows who allows herself to be murdered in order to save her child,
have just as genuine mother love and love just as sacred as that
which burns in the breast of woman. The ingenious ant, which tends
its fields, gathers its harvests, keeps slaves and armies and goes
to war, and performs about all the antics of civilized man except
maltreating the females and drinking gin, is not less civilized,
and its civilization is not less real, because it is miniature. And
the Christian who goes to church on Sunday and wails long prayers
and then goes home and stuffs his alimentary with the quivering
vitals of his naive fellows, and through the week lashes the flanks
of his overburdened horse till the strained tendons are ready to
snap, is not less criminal because he is strategic, and his crimes
are not less infernal because they have no penalty but his
conscience and no judge but himself. Whether we realize it or not
the doctrine that on mankind’s account all the rest of the animal
world came into being and that all non-human beings are mere hunks
devoid of all psychic qualities found in man, is a doctrine not one
whit more sagacious than the old geocentric theory of the
universe.</p>
<p>Man has defined himself as the “paragon of the universe.” I do
not say that he is not. I simply say that if he is, the universe
has no cause for dry eyes. Man’s treatment of his own kind
especially his conduct toward the forms of life differing from him
have been such as to brand him as a most ill-mannered and immodel
organism. Human beings have been sufficiently clever and
sufficiently devoted to each other to evolve into the masters of
the earth, but instead of converting themselves into preceptors for
the conquered races, they have become the butchers of the universe.
Instead of becoming the models and school-masters of the world in
which they have outstripped, and striving to repair the clumsy
natures and regulate the straying feet of those by means of whom
they have been hoisted into distinction, they have become colossal
pedants and assassins, proclaiming themselves the pets and gods of
creation and teaching each other that other races are mere fixtures
to furnish food and amusement for themselves. They inculcate as a
rule of conduct—and they preach it valiantly—that each should act
upon others as he himself would choose to be acted upon. This ideal
of social rectitude has been promulgated by the sages of the
species for more than 2,000 years. But with miserable pusillanimity
they confine its application to the members of their own species.
No non-human is too innocent or too interesting or too wonderful to
escape the most frightful humiliations, if by those humiliations
human comfort or human amusement or human whim is in any way
whatever garnished.</p>
<p>Look at the horse! No nobler and more beautiful creature is
found in all the animal realm. A marvel of strength, speed and
splendor. The most useful and most consummate associate of man.
What wonderful possibilities of reciprocity! Man takes the horse
from the plains, where he is exposed to the inclemencies of
weather, the contingencies of food and the blunders of his own
childlike nature. He gives him regular meals, pleasant shelter,
intellectual surroundings, and a home. The horse in return gives
man the benefit of his superior strength and speed, bearing man and
his burdens and supplementing in a thousand ways the inadequate
energies of his mentor. These are the possibilities, the
ideal—gigantic strength supplementing superior wisdom. Beautiful
reciprocity! What are the actualities? Sad, indeed! The horse is
not an associate but a <em>slave</em>. He has no rights, and is
seldom suspected of being entitled to feelings or vanities at all.
He is treated as if he had merely existence and usefulness. He is
neglected, overburdened and overworked, beaten, insulted, starved,
maimed, misunderstood, deprived of leisure and liberty,
unconsidered—doomed to an environment out of which has been drained
every element calculated to promote his happiness and intelligence
and perpetuate his nobility and beauty. He is a mere suggestion of
the might-have-been. His regal neck has wilted; the splendid flanks
are lean and drawn; the ambitious face is sad. The proud galloper
of the plains, the companion of the winds, bearing fire in his
nostrils and thunder in his hoofs, has become a soured,
impoverished, broken-hearted but faithful <em>wreck</em>. The stars
of heaven never looked down on a more pitiful sight than that of a
horse, after having drudged all his days in the service of his
lord, cast out in his helpless old age to wander and perish.</p>
<p>Our own happiness and that of our species are believed to be so
much more important than that of others that we sacrifice without
scruple the most sacred prerogatives of others in order that our
own may be fastidiously trimmed. Even for a tooth or a feather to
wear on our vanity marauders are sent through the forests of the
earth to ravage and depopulate them. Beautiful beings which fill
the woods with song and juvenility are compelled to sprawl lifeless
and disheveled on the skulls of unconscionable sillies. Criminal
and inconvenient races are exterminated with eager and superfluous
violence. Thousands of innocent and helpless souls are caught up
and carried by unfeeling emissaries into foul dungeons and there
doomed by ghoulish clowns of science to the most protracted,
useless, and damning victimizations. It is enough almost to make
villains weep—the cold-blooded manner in which human beings cut the
throats, dash out the brains, and discuss the flavor of their
victims at their cannibalistic feasts.</p>
<p>Look at the scenes to be met with in all our streets and
stockyards! An army of butchers standing in blood ankle deep and
working themselves to exhaustion carving the throats of their
helpless fellows—unsuspecting oxen with limpid eyes looking up at
the deadly pole-ax and a moment later lying a-quiver under its
relentless thud—struggling swine swinging by their hinders with
their life leaping from their gashed jugulars—an atmosphere in
perpetual churn with the groans and yells of the massacred—streets
thronged with unprocessioned funerals—everywhere corpses dangling
from sale-hooks or sprawling on chopping blocks—men and women
kneeling nightly by their pillow sides and congratulating
themselves on their whiteness and rising and leaping on the bloody
remains of some slaughtered fellow—such are the spectacles in all
our streets and stockyards, and such are the enormities perpetrated
day after day by Christian cannibals on the defenseless dumb ones
of this world.</p>
<p>Holy days, days above all others when it seems men’s minds would
be bent on compassion, are farces of gluttony and ferocity.
Unfeeling ruffians cowardly shoot down defenceless birds or prowl
the country in rival squads massacring every living creature that
is not able to escape them—<em>and for no higher or humaner purpose
than just to see who can kill the most!</em> This is egoism
unparalleled on the face of the earth. No species of animal except
man plunges to such depths of atrocity. It is bad enough in all
conscience for one being to suppress another in order to tear it to
pieces and swallow it, but when such outrages are perpetrated by
organized packs just for pastime it becomes an enormity beyond
characterization. The insectivora, the carnivora, and the reptilia
are cruel. It is horrible to contemplate the enormous wickedness
perpetrated on the less offensive races by these relentless brutes.
But the crimes committed by the hominine species are the most
insolent and extravagant in the universe. Non-human murderers are
ruthless, but even serpents and hyenas do not exterminate for
sport. A universe is, indeed, to be pitied whose dominating
inhabitants are so unconscious, so irresponsible, and so ethically
repulsive that they make life a commodity, mercy a disease, and
systematic massacre a pastime and profession.</p>
<p>I am a vegetarian because I believe in the golden rule. <em>Act
toward others as you would that others would act toward you</em>,
has been the basic precept of the morals of the generations. This
wonderful rule has been mouthed and mouthed since the days of
Confucius, 2,400 years ago. But it never has been <em>lived</em>.
Do as you would be done by. Certainly. <em>But to whom?</em> Each
class or clan has been its own little clique to whom it after a
fashion observed this rule. Slavery and slaughter have been the
rule toward everyone else. The Troglodytes hunted the Ethiopians in
four-horse chariots with as little compunction as Americans hunt
the wood-deer today. A Roman could take the life of his Gallic
slave with as perfect impunity as an American can slay his bovine
servant today. Yet to kill a Gaul was as really murder as to kill a
Roman. It hasn’t been very long since all the Christian nations
hunted their dusky brethren in Africa and sold and loaned and
lashed them as we do the horse today. All these crimes are now
matters of course to us. It is the same old story. We can see
behind us but not around us. After so many centuries the solidarity
of <em>our species</em> has dimly dawned on us, but we can not
discern the solidarity of all the animal world. We go on daily
committing crimes as horrible as those we execrate. And we do it
for the very same reason our long line of ancestors have done it,
because the human mind is too feeble to be conscious of all the
complicated relations which it is called upon to be conscious
of.</p>
<p>The apology of the criminals has always been the same as it is
today—that the crucified creatures were of a different order of
being—that a chasm yawned between the persecutors and the
persecuted—that there was not a solidarity. The Gaul has no rights
because he was a “barbarian.” The fact that he has a nervous system
and a love of life had nothing to do with it. The black man had no
rights that were inconvenient to respect because he had no soul and
because his subordination was God-ordained. And the honest ox and
the faithful dog have no rights today, <em>because they were made
to be murdered.</em></p>
<p>I am a vegetarian because I believe in justice. There is
injustice in the universe, because there are beings in it who
monopolize its sweets and opportunities. They want their own
pleasures and also the pleasures of others. They shuffle upon
others their bitters, and at the same time rob them of their
sweets. Others live, not as ends, but as means and conveniences. I
do not eat my fellow creatures, for the same reason I do not
enslave my brother and treat my sister as an appendage and
otherwise monopolize the sweets and opportunities of the planet.
There are on this ball billions of beings. They are my fellow
creatures. So far as I can make out they have approximately the
same right to existence and to the enjoyment of existence as I
have. I do not want their pleasures and I do not want them to drink
my sorrows. I want simply my own and I am perfectly content to rob
no one. In the words of another, “I never want happiness that gives
another pain. I wish not happiness from others—only happiness out
of the bosom of the great <span class="small-caps">all</span> which
comes like the red flowers of the oleander.”</p>
<p>I am a vegetarian because it is logical and natural to be so.
The vegetable world contains all the elements necessary to human
sustenance, and in a much more prime condition than they are found
in the diseased tissues of our mistreated servants. The belief that
we can not have peach in our dimples and diamonds in our brains
without dead bodies in our digestion is a belief having no
foundation except ignorance. Vegetal fibrin is identical with
animal fibrin, and vegetal albumen is identical with animal
albumen. Even in albuminoids, in the supply of which meat is
supposed to be rather exclusive, there are vegetables, nuts and
grains that far exceed chops and steaks. Fish, for instance,
contains about 13 per cent. of albuminoids, pork on average 16 per
cent., and beef 17½ per cent.; while nuts furnish from 8 to 25 per
cent., grains 7 to 15 per cent., eggs 14 per cent., cheese 29 per
cent., peas 22 per cent., lentils 25 per cent., and beans from 22
to 35 per cent. The vegetable world, in fact, is the natural
storehouse and the only original storehouse from which animals may
derive energy. No animal can produce protoplasm, which is the basis
of all life and energy. This is a function of the plant, and of the
plant only. All an animal can do is to take it after it is produced
and burn it up. Animals are simply locomotives consuming the energy
which plants slowly accumulate from the sun. It is a graceful and
perfect process—plants storing up energy from the soil and sun, the
inorganic, and the animal using this energy and completing the
circle by sending the elements back again to the inorganic. And it
is a “barbarism” in nature for animals to violate this beautiful
arrangement by turning around and swallowing each other.</p>
<p>To one accustomed to obtain his supply of protoplasm chiefly
from the bones of other animals instead of from the kingdom of the
plant, the assertion that it is possible not only to sustain but to
enhance existence on a fleshless diet seems very strange. It is not
strange that such an assertion should seem strange. Anything is
strange to the uninitiated. And the amount of ignorance on this
subject is well-nigh pitiable. The delusion that flesh is the most
genuine source of human energy has become so fixed that it actually
disturbs the respiration of nineteen out of twenty to be told that
flesh compared with many foods is a dilute form of nutrition, and
that more than half the inhabitants of the earth today are
practical and prosperous vegetarians. There is no reason known to
science or experience why human beings may not keep up as
profitable and as interesting an existence without flesh as with
it. In fact, after an experience of four years and a rather careful
contemplation of the matter, I assert that physiological integrity
may be more accurately sustained by a judicious diet of fruits,
grains, vegetables, and nuts than by a diet in which carrion is a
distinguished constituent. Man is not naturally a carnivorous
animal. He has evolved from the frugivorous anthropoids, and has a
long biological ancestry of vegetarians. His mouth, digestive
organs, skin structure, and modes of life are all unadapted to a
carnivorous life. Man has probably adopted predatory habits almost
within historic times. Not only the student and the thinker but the
manual laborer as well is benefited by a fleshless regimen. A
breakfast of oatmeal and cream, a couple of eggs on toast, whole
wheat muffins and butter, and a nice rich apple or banana is much
more civilized, nutritious and economical than a breakfast in which
bloody beef plays chief role. The most successful burden bearers of
the world today are vegetarians. The Turkish longshoremen, perhaps
the most powerful bipeds on the planet (except the gorilla), are
lifelong vegetarians. They will pick up a burden of six or eight
hundred pounds and walk away with it with no more effort than is
made by a meat-eating Englishman in carrying two hundred. De
Lesseps said that the Suez Canal, the greatest engineering
achievement ever accomplished on the earth, never could have been
finished, on account of the heat and the slavish character of the
labor, by meat-eating Europeans. It had to be done by the
barley-feeding Bedouins and Armenians. De Lesseps became a
vegetarian and remained one to his death, from his experiences in
the building of the Suez Canal. The peasantry of Russia, Italy,
Germany, Ireland, and even Norway and Sweden away from the coast,
are largely vegetarians. So, also, are millions in the Orient.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of economy alone vegetarianism ought to
appeal powerfully to everyone possessed of undoubted sanity. If men
would take the beautiful fruits of the soil, fresh from nature’s
hand, instead of sitting down and devouring in the form of the
accumulated residuum of ruminants an acre at a meal, the problem of
the increasing density of mundane population would not be such a
grave one.</p>
<p>I am a vegetarian, therefore, because cannibalism is
unnecessary. I can live just as well and be just as happy without
drinking the blood of my fellows, and why <em>should</em> I slay
them? Why <em>should</em> I not live and let live—especially when I
can do it just as well as not? It is not <em>necessary</em> that
ten thousand creatures should give up their lives in order that I
may keep mine, and if I make any pretensions to morality why should
I require them to do it? If you say such a thing <em>is</em>
necessary in your case, I say to you it is not—and further, that if
it were, it would be your duty as an ethical being to call on your
undertaker. There is no sense in carnivora talking about ethics and
justice and mercy, for their very existence is a travesty on such
things. It makes me indignant and sad when I hear men deplore sin
and prate about justice and love and mercy, when the very energy
they expend in preaching justice and mercy is obtained from the
skeletons and sensibilities of their fellows. It is a spectacle
that ought to make the imps of netherdom tremble for their
laurels—man, the remorseless glutton, going about with a tongue and
a knife, with his tongue preaching peace, mercy, and love, and with
his knife making the very earth sodden with blood.</p>
<p>It may seem irreverent, but I say it, that if Christians can do
these crimes and yet so act as to earn celestial ecstasies, hell
will be uninhabited. I would like to retain respect for the
religion of my boyhood, but when I see that religion look with
equanimity and even levity upon a hemorrhage wide as the continents
and horrible even to heathens, not only wink at it but actually
perpetuate it, and even scaffold those few emancipated souls who
are trying to curtail it—I almost despair of it.</p>
<p>Vegetarianism appeals not to the selfish but to the noble. It is
for beings who love justice, liberty, reciprocity. It teaches the
Golden Rule in its only sensible sense. It recognizes the moral
progress of the past and points to those still higher highlands
toward which the ages have ever heaved. It teaches to do as you
would be done by. “To whom?” Not to the black man and the white
woman alone, but to the sorrel horse and the gray squirrel as well.
Yes, do as you would be done by—not to creatures of your own
anatomy or your own guild only, <em>but to all creatures.</em> In a
world like this, with its tangles and irrationalities, it is
impossible to act in every particular at all times and to all
creatures ideally. This is not an ideal world, and if we are to
judge of the universe by the clod we root and ride on, the whole
thing is not a flattering affair. Our relations to our fellow
<em>men</em> are not ideal, and from the nature of things <em>they
never can be</em>. But we think we can do amply when we do the best
we can. The difference between him who attempts honestly and
faithfully to do just the best he can and him who knows little and
cares less is as great as the difference between January and
June.</p>
<p>Enjoy and let others enjoy. Live and let live. Do more. <em>Live
and help live.</em> Do to beings below you as you would be done by
beings above you. Pity the grub and the ladybug, and have mercy on
the mole. Poor, defenceless, undeveloped, untaught creatures. They
are our fellow mortals. They are enmeshed in the same mighty
processes as we. They came from the same source and are destined to
the same end. They lived, moved and breathed on primeval land
fragments when the continents we creep over were sleeping in the
seas. They are our ancestors. They are the forms of being that have
made you and me possible. Let us be brothers and sisters to them,
not ruffians; pity them and help them and pray for their untaught
natures. Let us be consistent, for we have but one life to live. We
are striving for the amelioration of this suffering world. Let us
be economical. Let us not with one hand pour oil upon its agonies
and with the other inflict gashes. Let us vow allegiance to the
principles of universal courtesy and love, whether to the lone worm
wandering in the twilight of consciousness, the feathered forms of
the fields and forest, the heifer of the meadows, the simple savage
on the banks of the gladed river, the political slaves whom men
call wives, or the economic exiles of industry. The same spirit of
sympathy and fraternity that broke the black man’s manacles and is
today melting the white woman’s chains will tomorrow emancipate the
workingman and the heifer, and as the ages bloom and the great
wheels of the centuries grind on, the same spirit of leaven shall
banish <em>Selfishness</em> from the earth and convert the planet
finally to one unbroken and unparalleled spectacle of
<em>Peace</em>, <em>Justice and Solidarity.</em></p>
